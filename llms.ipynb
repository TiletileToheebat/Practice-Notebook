    "*A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. LLMs are trained on massive datasets and built on machine learning: specifically, a type of neural network called a transformer model. In summary, an LLM is a computer program that has been fed enough examples to be able to recognize and interpret human language or other types of complex data.\n",

    "\n",
    "*GPT models are a family of language models developed by OpenAI and are built upon the transformer architecture.They are pre-trained using a self-supervised objective to predict the next word in a sequence, given all previous words. This gives the models an in-depth understanding of natural language structure that can then be leveraged for various downstream NLP tasks. The models are trained on massive text corpora to predict the next token autoregressivelly, given the previous context*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Training data serves as the foundation for a Large Language Model (LLM), providing the vast collection of text examples that the model learns from to understand language patterns, grammar, and context, enabling it to generate human-like text and perform various language-related tasks effectively. It's the key component that allows an LLM to grasp the nuances of human language and respond appropriately to prompts and questions.*\n"

This helps the model to specialized tasks while retaining the general knowledge it learned during initial training. `for instance`, A healthcare chatbot can be created by fine-tuning an LLM on medical texts, patient interactions, and clinical guidelines. This helps the model provide more accurate medical advice while understanding specialized terminology and context.*\n",
